# ## Project Objectives

## Statement

Make a Task Manager folowing a youtube video(https://youtu.be/_zGL_MU29zs) for practice and learn about Material UI and improve my React, NodeJS, Express, Postgres and Sequelize skills.


I'm going to add users and authentication by myself.

## Show project local

- Clone github repo
- Open a terminal/cmd in the api folder
- Run npm install
- Open a terminal/cmd in the client folder
- Run npm install
- You're going to need a file in the src folder called ".env"
- To start the api local you need some credentials from postgres
- Like DB_USER=YourPostgresUser,DB_PASSWORD=YourPostgresPassword, DB_HOST=localhost, DB_NAME=YourDBName
- after you got that you can use npm start in the api folder & npm start in the client folder
- Now you can see the app in your localhost
